/*
*    Protocol definitions for communication between reWASD and GIMX adapter with reWASD firmware.
*    To emulate virtual USB device for other PC or console reWASD uses the same hardware as GIMX project (see https://blog.gimx.fr),
*    but it flashes its own firmware tailored specifically to reWASD.
*    After this flashing the adapter will be able to work with reWASD only and not be compatible with GIMX project anymore -
*    you will not need to install GIMX at all, because reWASD will communicate with the adapter directly.
*    Of course, if you do not need reWASD anymore, the firmware can be changed again with GIMX launcher.
*    The adapter is based on the pupular 'Pro Micro' board with atmega32u4 chip and USB-to-TTL converter.
*    You can build your own adapter using these instructions: https://gimx.fr/wiki/index.php?title=DIY_USB_adapter.
*    Alternatively, you can buy ready adapter from GIMX shop: https://blog.gimx.fr/product/gimx-adapter.
*    There can be different types of USB-to-TTL converters on the board, CP2102 is among the most popular.
*    The only requirement for reWASD as that it must support at least 500000 baud rate.
*    reWASD team wants to express special thanks to Mathieu Laurendeau for his hard work on GIMX project and developing this adapter!
*    Now reWASD is an alternative way to use this adapter and give more options to users.
